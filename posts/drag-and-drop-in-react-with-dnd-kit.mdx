DnD Kit is an awesome library I recently discovered while working on the new dashboard for [Super](https://super.so/). It makes the complex task of creating performant Drag-and-Drop UI interactions easier, with some interesting patterns and concepts. I spent some time creating a lot of cool interactions with the library and wanted to share some of the things I learned.

Lets get started

## Core Concepts

In most drag-and-drop UI interactions, there are typically two components:

- **Draggable components**, which are elements on a page that can be picked up, dragged, and dropped in designated areas;
- **Droppable components**, which are elements that act as _'designated areas'_ for draggable elements to be dropped.

You can see these components in action by playing around in the demo below:

<DraggableAndDroppable />

DndKit embraces this approach and provides two essential hooks for our applications:

- The `useDraggable` hook, which makes a component draggable;
- The `useDroppable` hook, which makes a component droppable.

## Making a component draggable

To make a component draggable, we can use the `useDraggable` hook. This hook takes a unique id as an argument and returns an object with several properties. The most important ones are:

1. `setNodeRef` - a ref we attach to the HTML element we want to turn into a draggable element.
2. `listeners` and `attributes` - objects we spread on the element we want to listen for dragging.
3. `transform` - a `CSS.Transform` object to position the draggable component as its being dragged.

Here's an example of how all these elements come together:

```tsx
function Draggable(props: DraggableProps) {
  const { attributes, listeners, setNodeRef, transform } = useDraggable({
    id: props.id,
  });

  return (
    <button
      ref={setNodeRef}
      style={{
        transform: CSS.Transform.toString(transform),
      }}
      {...listeners}
      {...attributes}
    >
      Draggable
    </button>
  );
}
```

You can play around by toggling the the diffrent props in the demo below:
