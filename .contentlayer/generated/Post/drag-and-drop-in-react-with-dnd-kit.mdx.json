It makes the complex task of creating performant Drag-and-Drop UI interactions easier, with some interesting patterns and concepts. I spent some time creating a lot of cool interactions with the library and wanted to share some of the things I learned.\n\nLets get started\n\n## Core Concepts\n\nIn most Drag-and-drop UI interactions, there are usually two types of components involved:\n\n- **Draggable components** which are elements on a page that we can pick up, drag and drop in designated drop areas; and\n- **Droppable components**, which are elements that act as the 'designated drop areas' that draggable elements can be dropped over.\n\nYou can see these components in action by playing around in the demo below:\n\n<DraggableAndDroppable />\n\nDndKit embraces this concept, providing two essential hooks for applications: useDraggable and useDroppable. The former makes a component draggable, while the latter makes it droppable. These hooks are exported from the `@dnd-kit/core` package; install it by running the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm install @dnd-kit/core\n```\n\nTo manage interactions between draggable and droppable components, `@dnd-kit/core` also exports a `<DndContext>` component. This component uses the React Context API to share data between draggable and droppable components, so we need to wrap them with it:\n\n```tsx {2}\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport { DndContext } from \"@dnd-kit/core\";\nimport { Draggable } from \"./Draggable\";\nimport { Droppable } from \"./Droppable\";\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <DndContext>\n      <Draggable />\n      <Droppable />\n    </DndContext>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n> 👍 Success\n>\n> The Context API is a great way to share data between components without having to pass props down the component tree. It's also a great way to avoid prop drilling. If you're not familiar with the Context API, I recommend reading [this article](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/how-to-use-react-context-effectively) by Kent C. Dodds.\n\n### Draggables\n\nThe `useDraggable` hook is used to make components draggable. It takes an input object as an argument, which must include a unique `id`. It returns an object with several properties, of which we are currently interested in:\n\n1. `setNodeRef` - a ref we attach to the HTML element we want to make draggable. This is the essential part of how we provide dndkit with the element that needs to be dragged.\n2. `listeners` and `attributes` - objects we can spread on the HTML element to listen for a drag event.\n3. `transform` - an object with the x- and y-coordinates of a draggable element in 2D. We'll use this to update the `translate` property, allowing us to move the draggable component on the screen.\n\nHere's an example of how all these elements come together:\n\n```tsx\nfunction Draggable(props: DraggableProps) {\n  const { attributes, listeners, setNodeRef, transform } = useDraggable({\n    id: props.id,\n  });\n\n  return (\n    <button\n      ref={setNodeRef}\n      style={{\n        transform: CSS.Transform.toString(transform),\n      }}\n      {...listeners}\n      {...attributes}\n    >\n      Draggable\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n> 💡 Tip\n> setNodeRef is a callback ref - you can find out more of how they work here\n\n### Droppables\n\nThe `useDroppable` hook is used to make components Droppable. Similar to `useDraggable`, it takes an input object as an argument, with a required unique `id`. It returns an object with several properties, of which we are currently interested in.\n\n1. `setNodeRef` - a ref we attach to the HTML element we want to make droppable. This is how we tell dndkit that an element is a drop area.\n2. `isOver` - a Boolean that is `true` if a droppable component is over the droppable component.\n\nHere is how of how all these elements come together:\n\n```tsx\nfunction Droppable(props: DroppableProps) {\n  const { setNodeRef, isOver } = useDroppable({\n    id: props.id,\n  });\n\n  return (\n    <div\n      ref={setNodeRef}\n      style={{\n        backgroundColor: isOver ? \"lightblue\" : \"white\",\n      }}\n    >\n      Droppable\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Examples\n\nNow that we've discussed the core concepts of the dndkit, let's go through examples of how to use them to create beautiful drag-and-drop interactions. We'll cover four common use cases found on the web:\n\n1. **Free Drag-and-Drop**: Drag and drop an element across the entire screen, like in canvas-based applications like Figma and Excalidraw.\n2. **Classic Drag-and-Drop**: Drag and drop items into one or more droppable areas.\n3. **Single Container Sortables**: Drag list items to change their order within a single container.\n4. **Multi Container Sortables**: Drag items between multiple containers, sort them, and sort the containers.\n5. **Sortables** which are usually lists where each list item is both draggable and droppable. And rearrange or sort as a single component is dragged.\n\n### Free Drag-and-Drop\n\n<DraggableAndDroppable />\n\nTo build, we need to store the draggable component's data, including its x- and y-positions, in state. We'll leverage the `onDragEnd` event emitted by the **`<DndContext />`**. This function fires after a draggable item is dropped, and the event object passed to it contains data about the component. We can use this data to update the component's position in state.\n\nYou can see how this is done with the interactive demo below:\n\n### Classic Drag-and-Drop\n\n<DraggableAndDroppable />\n\nTo build this we’ll need both draggable and droppable components. We need an array of IDs of our droppable containers and a piece of state to track which droppable component our draggable component is over. We'll use the onDragEnd function to check if a draggable component is over a particular droppable component. If it is, we'll update the state and add the draggable component as a child of the droppable container in the UI.\n\nYou can see how this is done with the interactive demo below:\n\nDnD Kit is an awesome library I recently discovered while working on the new dashboard at Super.
