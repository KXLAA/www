In this post, I explain the core concepts behind DnD Kit and implement a variety of examples that demonstrate the core features of the library. In the end, we will put everything we have learned together and build a form builder application similar to Google Form using DnD Kit.\n\n<Image\n  alt={`Bridge`}\n  src={`/images/bridge.jpg`}\n  width={1440}\n  height={960}\n  priority\n/>\n\n## Heading H2\n\nThis is an example blog post with React components. This page is using the `Image` component from Next.js.\n\n```jsx:example-post.mdx\n<Image\n  alt={`Bridge`}\n  src={`/images/bridge.jpg`}\n  width={1440}\n  height={960}\n  priority\n/>\n```\n\n### Code Blocks\n\nThis starter also comes with fancy code blocks with code titles.\n\n```jsx:example.jsx\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction Example() {\n  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call \"count\"\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>\n        Click me\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n- First, we need a way to target the specific element we want to drag and keep track of it as we drag. We can do this by passing the setNodeRef function returned by useDraggable to the ref of the DOM element we want to drag:\n\n  ```jsx\n  const { setNodeRef } = useDraggable({\n    id: \"draggable-1\",\n  });\n\n  return <div ref={setNodeRef}>Draggable</div>;\n  ```\n\n- Next, we need to keep track of the position of the draggable element as we drag it. We can do this by passing the attributes returned by useDraggable to the draggable element:\n\n  ```jsx\n  const { attributes, listeners, setNodeRef, transform } = useDraggable({\n    id: \"draggable-1\",\n  });\n\n  return (\n    <div\n      ref={setNodeRef}\n      style={{\n        transform: transform\n          ? `translate3d(${transform.x}px, ${transform.y}px, 0)`\n          : undefined,\n      }}\n      {...attributes}\n      {...listeners}\n    >\n      Draggable\n    </div>\n  );\n  ```\n\n- Finally, we need to make sure that the draggable element is rendered in the correct position as we drag it. We can do this by passing the transform returned by useDraggable to the draggable element's style:\n\n  ```jsx\n  const { attributes, listeners, setNodeRef, transform } = useDraggable({\n    id: \"draggable-1\",\n  });\n\n  return (\n    <div\n      ref={setNodeRef}\n      style={{\n        transform: transform\n          ? `translate3d(${transform.x}px, ${transform.y}px, 0)`\n          : undefined,\n      }}\n      {...attributes}\n      {...listeners}\n    >\n      Draggable\n    </div>\n  );\n  ```\n\nGo back [Home](/).\n",

          "raw": "\nDnD Kit is an awesome library I recently discovered while working on the new dashboard for [Super](https://super.so/). It makes the complex task of creating performant Drag-and-Drop UI interactions easier, with some interesting patterns and concepts. I spent some time creating a lot of cool interactions with the library and wanted to share some of the things I learned.\n\nLets get started\n\n## Core Concepts\n\nIn most drag-and-drop UI interactions, there are typically two components:\n\n- **Draggable components**, which are elements on a page that can be picked up, dragged, and dropped in designated areas;\n- **Droppable components**, which are elements that act as _'designated areas'_ for draggable elements to be dropped.\n\nYou can see these components in action by playing around in the demo below:\n\n<DraggableAndDroppable />\n\nDndKit embraces this approach and provides two essential hooks for our applications:\n\n- The `useDraggable` hook, which makes a component draggable;\n- The `useDroppable` hook, which makes a component droppable.\n\n### Draggables\n\nTo make a component draggable, we can use the `useDraggable` hook. This hook takes a unique id as an argument and returns an object with several properties. The most important ones are:\n\n1. `setNodeRef` - a ref we attach to the HTML element we want to turn into a draggable element.\n2. `listeners` and `attributes` - objects we spread on the element we want to listen for dragging.\n3. `transform` - a `CSS.Transform` object to position the draggable component as its being dragged.\n\nHere's an example of how all these elements come together:\n\n```tsx:Draggable.tsx\nfunction Draggable(props: DraggableProps) {\n  const { attributes, listeners, setNodeRef, transform } = useDraggable({\n    id: props.id,\n  });\n\n  return (\n    <button\n      ref={setNodeRef}\n      style={{\n        transform: CSS.Transform.toString(transform),\n      }}\n      {...listeners}\n      {...attributes}\n    >\n      Draggable\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nYou can play around by toggling the the diffrent props in the demo below:\n\n### Droppables\n\nTo make a component droppable, we can use the `useDroppable` hook. This hook takes a unique id as an argument and returns an object with several properties. The most important ones are:\n\n1. `setNodeRef` - a ref we attach to the HTML element we want to turn into a droppable element.\n2. `listeners` and `attributes` - objects we spread on the element we want to listen for dragging.\n3. `isOver` - a boolean that tells us if the draggable element is currently over the droppable element.\n\nHere's an example of how all these elements come together:\n\n```tsx:Droppable.tsx\nfunction Droppable(props: DroppableProps) {\n  const { attributes, listeners, setNodeRef, isOver } = useDroppable({\n    id: props.id,\n  });\n\n  return (\n    <div\n      ref={setNodeRef}\n      style={{\n        backgroundColor: isOver ? \"lightblue\" : \"white\",\n      }}\n      {...listeners}\n      {...attributes}\n    >\n      Droppable\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n",
