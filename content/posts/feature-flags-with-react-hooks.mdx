Feature flags are boolean values that we can use to conditionally show or hide parts of our application. This blog currently uses feature flags to hide incomplete articles and pages that are still being worked on.

Much has been written about the benefits of using feature flags. You can check out [this article](https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/deploys-wrong-way-change-user-experience) for a good summary of their benefits. In this post, I'll walk you through building a minimal feature flagging system using React hooks.

### Storing the feature flags

First, we will store all the information about our features as a JSON object:

```json
{
  "feature1": {
    "environments": {
      "production": {
        "enabled": false
      },
      "development": {
        "enabled": false
      }
    }
  },
  "feature2": {
    "environments": {
      "production": {
        "enabled": true
      },
      "development": {
        "enabled": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Each feature has an `environment` property, which is an object containing two properties: `development` and `production`. Each of these properties contains an additional object with a single property, `enabled`, which is a boolean value. We can use this to enable or disable a particular feature depending on the environment that the application is currently in.

### Checking for a feature with Hooks

Before building the hooks, let's create TypeScript types for our `features.json`. We need a `Feature` type that is a union of all the keys in our features object:

```ts
//our json object
import features from "./features.json";

//A union of the keys (features) in our json object
type Feature = keyof typeof features;
```

Next, we need to define a `FeatureConfig` type, which specifies the environments and features that are enabled:

```ts
type FeatureConfig = {
  environments: {
    production: {
      enabled: boolean;
    };
    development: {
      enabled: boolean;
    };
  };
};
```

Finally, we combine the two types using the TypeScript [Record utility](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#recordkeys-type) to create the `FeatureSet` type. This type represents the entire `features.json`:

```ts
type FeatureSet = Record<Feature, FeatureConfig>;
```

We will build two hooks to check if a feature is enabled. The first hook, `useFeatureCheck`, returns a function that takes in a feature name as an argument and checks if that feature is enabled based on our `features.json`:

```ts
function useFeatureCheck() {
  return React.useCallback((feature: Feature) => {
    //get the feature config
    const featureConfig = features[feature];

    //check if feature has been configured
    if (!featureConfig) return false;

    const { environments } = featureConfig;

    //check for the environments the feature is enabled in
    switch (process.env.NODE_ENV) {
      case "production":
        return environments.production.enabled;
      case "development":
        return environments.development.enabled;
      default:
        return false;
    }
  }, []);
}
```

The second hook is the `useFeatures` hook. Within this hook, we loop over all the features and create a new object with the feature names as properties and their values booleans, indicating whether they are enabled or not. We will check if a feature is enabled using the function returned from the `useFeatureCheck` hook we built earlier:

```ts
export function useFeatures() {
  const checkFeature = useFeatureCheck();

  return React.useMemo(
    () =>
      Object.keys(features).reduce(
        (acc, feature) => ({
          ...acc,
          [feature]: checkFeature(feature),
        }),
        {} as Record<Feature, boolean>
      ),
    [checkFeature]
  );
}
```

We could also create another hook called `useFeature` that takes a feature name as an argument and returns a boolean indicating whether that feature is enabled or not:

```ts
export function useFeature(feature: Feature) {
  const checkFeature = useFeatureCheck();

  return React.useMemo(() => checkFeature(feature), [checkFeature, feature]);
}
```

### Using the hooks

We can now use these hooks to conditionally render our components:

```tsx
import { useFeatures } from "./useFeatures";

function Feature1() {
  return <div>Feature 1</div>;
}

function Feature2() {
  return <div>Feature 2</div>;
}

function App() {
  const features = useFeatures();

  return (
    <>
      {features.feature1 ? <Feature1 /> : null}
      {features.feature2 ? <Feature2 /> : null}
    </>
  );
}
```
