Welcome to the first article in a series where I will discuss how to build everyday UI components from scratch in React, with accessibility in mind.

In this edition, we will be building a Tabs component that follows the [WAI-ARIA Tabs Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/tabpanel/). Tabs are a set of layered sections of content, known as tab panels, that display one panel of content at a time:

Implementing the Tabs component may seem easy, but making it accessible for keyboard users and providing the right aria labels as per the WAI-ARIA Tabs Pattern can make it challenging to implement correctly. In this post, Iâ€™ll explain the WAI-ARIA Tabs Pattern and how we can implement it using React.

Here is the final code and demo of what we are going to be building:

## The component API

To make our component more flexible and reusable for our customers, we'll use the compound component pattern, inspired by Radix's implementation here:

```tsx
import * as Tabs from "./Tabs";

export default () => (
  <Tabs.Root>
    <Tabs.List>
      <Tabs.Trigger />
    </Tabs.List>
    <Tabs.Content />
  </Tabs.Root>
);
```
