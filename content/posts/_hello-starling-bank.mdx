Over the past couple of months, I left Lagos, Nigeria and moved to London, UK to join Starling Bank as a software engineer on the Online Bank team. I have been with Starling Bank for a little over two months now and I wanted to share what I've learned and what I've been up to since.

### Why leave Nigeria ?

Full disclosure, this is not my first time leaving Nigeria. I completed both my undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in the UK and left during the height of the pandemic in 2020. So, why did I return after two years?

Although I had a really good remote job in Nigeria, I felt that my career prospects were greatly limited there. Moreover, I was losing confidence that Nigeria was a place where I wanted to continue living due to various political and social issues. I don't want this to turn into a rant about how terrible Nigeria is, but you can read this blog post that perfectly captures my feelings about the future of Nigeria as a country.

## Why Starling Bank ?

My interest in Starling Bank can be summarised in three parts: the complexity of the banking domain, the scale and success of the product, and the exposure to new technologies and approaches.

Starling Bank is a licensed bank, which means it is subject to added scrutiny and processes that not many companies face. One drawback of working with startups, in my opinion, is that the code you write can feel very disposable. This can sometimes lead to reckless risks. In contrast, working in a bank where customer funds are at stake requires more caution. I was interested in seeing how this additional scrutiny would influence my approach to building software and shipping products.

The second reason is self-explanatory. With over 3.5 million current accounts and having won the Best British Current Account award consecutively for many years, Starling Bank is a popular and beloved bank. As such, any code or product built has the opportunity to provide significant impact in the lives of many people. I was very interested in working with a team that ships such a beloved product and learning from them.

Finally, let's talk about the technology behind Starling Bank's platform. It is mostly written in Java, a language that I have no experience in. However, I was excited to jump in and explore these unknown technologies. Additionally, Starling's infrastructure and DevOps are quite mature and involved.
