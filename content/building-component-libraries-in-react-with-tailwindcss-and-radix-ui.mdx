DnD Kit is a lightweight, highly configurable and accessible library that makes creating drag-and-drop interactions with react easy. In this post, I explain the core concepts behind DnD Kit and implement a variety of examples that demonstrate the core features of the library. In the end, we will put everything we have learned together and build a form builder application similar to Google Form using DnD Kit.

<Image
  alt={`Bridge`}
  src={`/images/bridge.jpg`}
  width={1440}
  height={960}
  priority
/>

## Heading H2

This is an example blog post with React components. This page is using the `Image` component from Next.js.

```tsx
<Image
  alt={`Bridge`}
  src={`/images/bridge.jpg`}
  width={1440}
  height={960}
  priority
/>
```

### Code Blocks

This starter also comes with fancy code blocks with code titles.

```tsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

function Example() {
  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

- First, we need a way to target the specific element we want to drag and keep track of it as we drag. We can do this by passing the setNodeRef function returned by useDraggable to the ref of the DOM element we want to drag:

  ```tsx
  const { setNodeRef } = useDraggable({
    id: "draggable-1",
  });

  return <div ref={setNodeRef}>Draggable</div>;
  ```

- Next, we need to keep track of the position of the draggable element as we drag it. We can do this by passing the attributes returned by useDraggable to the draggable element:

  ```tsx
  const { attributes, listeners, setNodeRef, transform } = useDraggable({
    id: "draggable-1",
  });

  return (
    <div
      ref={setNodeRef}
      style={{
        transform: transform
          ? `translate3d(${transform.x}px, ${transform.y}px, 0)`
          : undefined,
      }}
      {...attributes}
      {...listeners}
    >
      Draggable
    </div>
  );
  ```

- Finally, we need to make sure that the draggable element is rendered in the correct position as we drag it. We can do this by passing the transform returned by useDraggable to the draggable element's style:

  ```tsx
  const { attributes, listeners, setNodeRef, transform } = useDraggable({
    id: "draggable-1",
  });

  return (
    <div
      ref={setNodeRef}
      style={{
        transform: transform
          ? `translate3d(${transform.x}px, ${transform.y}px, 0)`
          : undefined,
      }}
      {...attributes}
      {...listeners}
    >
      Draggable
    </div>
  );
  ```
