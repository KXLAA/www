During my most recent one-on-one meetings with my manager at work, we discussed OpenAPI and code generation. If you're not familiar, [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) is a formal specification for describing HTTP APIs—it can be written in JSON or YAML. 

At work, we generate HTTP clients for most of our frontend applications, including mobile apps, from OpenAPI specifications that are automatically generated from our backend Java services.

On one of the web clients, we use [tanstack query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) with the generated HTTP clients to manage the server-side state. This involves importing the client for the particular service you are working with and using `useQuery` or `useMutation` to make the requests:

```tsx
import services from "@/generated/services"
import { useQuery} from '@tanstack/react-query'

 // Queries
const query = useQuery({ queryKey: ['statements'], queryFn: services.getUsersStatements })
```

I've always had issues with this approach as it wasn't as ergonomic as it could be. My ideal solution would generate tanstack query hooks directly from the services. This makes perfect sense — whenever I use these services, I create custom hooks to encapsulate the service logic anyway. Rather than importing `useQuery` and the service as separate pieces, we could simply import and use a single, ready-made hook:

```tsx
import { useGetUserStatementsQuery } from "@/generated/services"

 // Queries
const query = useGetUserStatementsQuery()
```

My manager acknowledged the value of this approach but explained that having a separate HTTP client felt the right level of abstraction. The client is simply a Javascript class with methods that make HTTP calls — methods we can use anywhere without tanstack query or even React. 

Generating custom hooks with built-in HTTP calls would restrict the client to React and tanstack query only. If we needed to change our server-state management approach later, we would run into problems. 

This approach would embed tanstack query at the wrong abstraction level, which would make future migrations more difficult. This conversation was very insightful, and I largely agree with this perspective.


tRPC, an RPC library for TypeScript that uses tanstack query under the hood, has recently embraced this approach with its most recent version. In previous versions, tRPC wrapped its generated client in custom versions of `useQuery` and `useMutation`. The [new version](https://trpc.io/blog/introducing-tanstack-react-query-client) now provides a function that returns an object matching the `QueryOptions` and `MutationOptions` interfaces native to tanstack query.

The reasons they give for this change align with the discussions my manager and I had about abstractions and finding the right level.

I have been playing around with [Hey API](https://heyapi.dev/) for tanstack query code generation, and it embraces a similar philosophy. Instead of generating custom tanstack query hooks, it  generates functions that return the `QueryOptions` and `MutationOptions` objects that consumers can use with `useQuery` or `useMutation`.

While this approach is a bit more verbose than custom hooks, I think it's the right level of abstraction for generated clients.
