        ## Week 1 - Functions
    </ToggleHeadingTitle>

    <ToggleHeadingContent>
        In programming we deal with two kind of elements - functions & data. Functions are the rules we use to manipulate data. A powerful programming language provides three key ways to do this:

        - **primitive expressions** - The **data types** which are the basic building blocks that language provides
        - a means of **combination** - where **primitive expressions** can be combined into **compound expressions**
        - a means of **abstraction** -where **compound expressions** can be **named** and manipulated as units

        ### Primitive expressions in Python

        A number is an example of a primitive expression:

        ```python
        42
        42
        ```

        We can combine numbers together with **operators** to form a **compound expression** which is evaluated:

        ```python
        1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/32 + 1/64 + 1/128

        0.9921875
        ```

        They are called expressions because they **return a usable output value**. The output of typing `42` into the python console is `42` .

        ### Call Expressions

        Call expressions apply functions to arguments. A function is a mapping from some input arguments to an output value.

        Rather than using operators we can use functions to create compound expressions. For example `add(10, 2)` does the same thing as `10 + 2`, but with different form.

        Compared to using operators like we did above, using a function has some benefits.

        A function may take an arbitrary number of arguments:

        ```python
        max(1, 4, 56)

        56
        ```

        Functions are more clear since the function name (the operator) always precedes the operands (the arguments) and the arguments are always wrapped in parentheses.

        This is especially true when you nest functions - where the arguments of a given function are the results of other functions:

        ```python
        max(min(1, -2), min(pow(3, 5), -4))

        -2
        ```

        Why are these important benefits ? - functions compared to using expressions are more re-useable.

        Instead of typing out a complex compound expression with all the operations it needs - you can just extract it to a function and call the function wherever you need.

        <u>__How are call expressions evaluated applied or called ?__</u>
        ```python
        max(7.5, 9.5)
        9.5
        ```
        - **max** is the operator, the name
        - `7.5` & `9.5` are operands - operands are the arguments to the function, they can also be functions themselves. These are the inputs to the function.
        - The arguments if they are functions are evaluated before the operator is applied

        ### Names & the Environment

        A name is the simplest means of **abstraction**. We can give functions and expressions names.

        With expressions these names are called variables and we create them using the **assignment statement**, which contains a name to the left of  **`=`** (the assignment operator) and a value to the right:
        ```python
        radius = 10
        radius
        10
        >>> 2 * radius
        20

        area, circumfrence  = pi * radius, 2 * pi * radius
        ```

        Assignment is a very simple for of **abstraction** as it allows us to refer to the results of compound operations. The **Environment** is responsible for keeping track of names, values, and bindings. It acts as the memory that remembers the names we assign to things in our program.


        <u>__How are assignment expressions evaluated ?__</u>
        - It evaluates all the expressions to the right of `=` from left to right
        - After evaluation the expressions - it binds all the names to the left of `=` to the resulting values in the current frame.

        ```python
        a = 1
        b = 2

        b, a = a + b, b
        ```

        ### Pure vs Non-Pure Functions
        **Pure functions** are functions that simply takes an input (their arguments) and returns a result (The Output). These functions **have no side effects when they are applied** - this means that the only thing they do is return the same output when called with the same arguments.

        ```python
        max(2, 20)
        20
        ```

        Pure functions are easier to test as its simply inputs & outputs,  can be composed more reliably into compound expressions and are essential when writing concurrent programs where multiple functions may be evaluated simultaneously.

        Pure functions are easier to test as its simply inputs & outputs,  can be composed more reliably into compound expressions and are essential when writing concurrent programs where multiple functions may be evaluated simultaneously.

        ```python
        print(print(1), print(2))

        1
        2
        None None
        ```
        The return value of print is `None` , while `1` & `2` are the side effects that print produced.

        ### Defining New Functions
        We can bind names to functions via user-defined function definitions. User-defined functions are functions not built into the interpreter  like `max` or imported like `add`. A function definition in python looks like this:

        ```python
        def square(x):
            return mul(x, x)
        ```
        - `def` is a reserved word that tells the interpreter that we are defining a function
        - `square` is the name of the function
        - `x` is a formal parameter or parameter

        The return statement of the function is evaluated when it is called - not when it is defined right away. No matter how many times the function is called - the return statement will be re-evaluated.

        Defining functions (bounding names to functions) allow us to use compound operations as building blocks in other functions, we could use square within another function:
        ```python
        def sum_squares(x, y):
            return add(square(x), square(y))

        sum_squares(3, 4)
        25
        ```

        ### Function Definitions & Environments
        How do user-defined functions change our understanding of environments ?

        - What happens when a parameter has the same name as a built in function ?
        - Can two functions share names without confusion?

        To answer these questions - it helps to think of Environments as a sequence of frames depicted as boxes — each box contains all the name and value pairs.

        We can think of an environemnt like a two column table where the first column contains the names and the second column contains the corresponding values which are bound to the names:

        For example take these lines of code:

        ```python
        from math import pi

        tau = 2 * pi
        ```
        The corresponding frame will look something like this:

        <table>
        <tr>
        <th>Names</th>
        <th>Values</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>pi</td>
        <td>3.141592653589793</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>tau</td>
        <td>6.283185307179586</td>
        </tr>
        </table>

        There is one global frame - this holds all the assignments & import statements of the current environment.

        However when a user defined function is called - a second local frame is created in the environment which is only accessible to that function - each instance of a function call has its own independent local frame. In this local frame:

        - The functions arguments are bound to the functions parameters — think of it as giving the  the parameter variable a value
        - The function body is executed

        So when a function is called - we have two frames:
        - The global frame where the function definition and other assignments are;
        - The Functions local frame, that contains parameter bindings — Each instance of a function application has its own local frame independent from other functions

        Depending on how many functions we call - we can have just as many frames - especially if we have nested functions.


        Fundamentally — Names are bound to values, which are distributed across many independent local frames, along with a single global frame that contains shared names. A new local frame is introduced every time a function is called, even if the same function is called twice.

        All these steps ensures that names resolve to the correct values at the correct time during program execution. This is what allows these functions to have the same behaviour:

        ```python
        def square(x):
            return mul(x, x)

        def square(y):
            return mul(y, y)
        ```

        As the scope of a local name is limited to the body of the user-defined function that defines it - the binding for x or y in different local frames are unrelated.


        ### Functions as abstractions
        Fundamentally functions are abstractions - Function definitions should be able to suppress details - we do not need to know exactly how a function is implemented to use it. This is Functional Abstraction.

        In functional abstraction we consider three things

        - The **domain** of a function - which is the set of arguments it can take
        - The **range** of the function - which is the set of values it can return
        - The **intent** of the function - which is the relationship between inputs & outputs and any side effects it might generate.

        ## Week 2 - Control, Higher-order functions & environments
    </ToggleHeadingTitle>

    <ToggleHeadingContent>
        Control statements give us the ability to make comparisons and preform different tasks based on the results of those comparisons.

        A control statement is a statement and unlike expressions evaluating a statement does not produce a value.

        Some other examples of statements in python are the `def` & `return` statements. Each statement describes a change to the state of the interpreter and executing that statement applies that change. The job of the python interpreter is to execute programs, composed of statements - **Statements govern the relationship among different expressions in a program and what happens to their results**.

        Statements are executed in order (i.e top - bottom) - however multi-line statements may redirect control flow - as such later statements may never be reached.

        ### Conditional statements - Selecting which statements to execute

        We can implement our own version of the inbuilt `abs` function using conditional statements:

        ```python
        def absolutee_value(x):
            """Compute abs(x)."""
            if x > 0:
                return x
            elif x === 0:
                return 0
            else:
                return -x

        result = absolutee_value(-2)
        ```

        When the conditional statements are executed - each clause (the lines that end in semicolons `:`) is considered in order.

        These clauses are called conditional expressions - they evaluate to a either a truthy value (`True`, a non-zero integer, etc.) or a falsy value (`False`, `0`, `None`, `""`, `[]`, etc.).

        If the result of that evaluation is a true value, the suite (which is everything after the semicolons) is executed. All other subsequent clauses in the conditional statement are then skipped.

        `else` can be seen as a catchall - this line will only be reached & its suite executed when all other `if` & `elif` expressions evaluate to false values.

       <div className='mb-4'> **Boolean Operators**</div>
        Python includes a couple of boolean operators - and, not, or used to combine and manipulate boolean values:

        ```python
        not None
        True

        not True
        False

        -1 and 0 and 1
        0
        ```

        ### Iteration - Expressing repetition
        We can use iterative control structures to execute a statement many times. One of such structures is a `while` statement:

        ```python
        def fib(n):
            """Compute the nth Fibonacci number, for n >=2"""
            pred, curr = 0, 1

            k = 2

            while k < n:
                pred, curr = curr, pred + curr
                k = k + 1

            return curr

        result = fib(8)
        ```

        When a while clause is executed its header expression (while `<expression>`:) is evaluated - if it is a true value the entire suite is executed and we return back to the header expression for evaluation.

        In order top prevent this process from going on indefinitely (infinite loop), the suite should always change some binding in each pass.


        ## Higher Order Functions
        Higher order function are functions that manipulate other functions - they either **accept functions as arguments** or **return functions as values**.

        ### Functions as arguments
        The functions below, although they do different things, share a common underlying pattern:

        ```python
        def sum_naturals(n):
            total, k = 0, 1
            while k <= n:
                total, k = total + k, k + 1
            return total

        def sum_cubes(n):
            total, k = 0, 1
                while k <= n:
                    total, k = total + k*k*k, k + 1
                return total
        ```

        The only difference is the name and the function of `k` used to compute the term to be added - we can **express the underlying pattern more generally** as a summation of terms:

        ```python
        def sumation(n, term):
            total, k = 0, 1
                while k <= n:
                total, k = total + term(k), k + 1
            return total

        def cube(x):
            return x*x*x

        def sum_cubes(n):
            return sumation(n, cube)

        result = sum_cubes(3)
        ```

        `summation` is an example of a higher order function - it takes in a function `term` as one of its parameters and uses that function within its body to carray out calculations.

         This is an example of abstraction - The `summation` function expresses the concept of summation itself rater than only functions that compute particular sums like  `sum_naturals` or `sum_cubes`.

         How does this idea of higher-order function affect our environment model for evaluation for functions ? - it applies gracefully without change.

         When a  function is called with some arguments, the functions parameters are bound to the values of those arguments (which may be functions) in a new local frame.

         ### Nested Functions

        We can also nest functions, we can do this to reduce the cluttering the global frame with small functions or avoiding function signature constraints:
        ```python
            def improve(update, close, guess =1):
                while not close(guess):
                    guess = update(guess)
                return guess


            def average(x, y):
                return (x + y)/2

            def sqrt_update(x, a):
                    return average(x, a/x)

            def sqrt(a):
                def sqrt_update(x):
                    return average(x, a/x)
                def sqrt_close(x):
                    return approx_eq(x * x, a)

                return improve(sqrt_update, sqrt_close)
        ```

        Like local assignment, local `def` statements only affect the current local frame -  These functions are only in scope while `sqrt` is being evaluated.

        These nested functions are also **lexically scoped** - They have access the variables & bindings inside the function (or scope) they are defined (not called).  In the example above `sqrt_update` & `sqrt_close` will both have access to any variables & bindings made in the `sqrt` function.

        The `sqrt` function in this example is the parent - with the **parents environment** - when a local function (`sqrt_update`) is called - **its local frame extends its parents environment**. Local functions are functions defined and used within another parent function.

        Local functions like the `sqrt_update` function carries with it some data: the value for **a** referenced in the environment (the `sqrt` functions environment) in which it was defined.

        Because they "enclose" information in this way, locally defined functions are often called *closures*.

        ### Functions as returned values

        Locally defined functions maintain their parent environment when they are returned, we can see this in action by considering an example of composing functions:

        ```python
        def compose1(f, g):
            def h(x):
                return f(g(x))
        return h

        def square(x):
            return x * x

        def successor(x):
            return x + 1

        square_successor = compose1(square, successor)
        result = square_successor(12)
        ```

        ### Currying

        We can use higher-order functions to convert a function that takes multiple arguments into a chain of functions that each take a single argument:

        ```python
        def curried_pow(x):
            def h(y):
            return pow(x, y)
        return h

        curried_pow(2)(3)
        ```

        This is called **currying** - This is useful when we require a function that takes only a single argument like the `map` function that applies a single-argument function to a sequence of values:
        ```python
        def curried_pow(x):
            def h(y):
                return pow(x, y)
            return h

        def map_to_range(start, end, f):
            while start < end:
                print(f(start))
                start = start + 1

        map_to_range(0, 10, curried_pow(2))
        ```
        Currying here allows us to use the same two functions to compute powers of other numbers without writing a specific function for each number whose powers we wish to compute.
